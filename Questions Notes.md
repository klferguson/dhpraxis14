###Questions: 
 
1) how is Zotero used?  
2) could take away dataset presentations on Dec 7th. and give back to guest speaker?  
3) have specific prompts for reading/discussion blog posts?  
4) 


###Workshops?

* Wordpress
* blogging best practices, digital writing (images, encouraging comments, linking)
* visualization tools
* preparing data
* python/NLTK
* GIS / CartoDB
* Terminal 

	[edit: I just looked at the workshops from last year, most of these I think would be great to do again. I wonder if the more technical/programming language ones were well attended?]
